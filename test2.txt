4. Schema Linking Algorithm (Section 3)
Goal: Identify subset of columns most relevant to the question.

Steps:
Extract

Keywords and literals from the question

Build Focused Schema

Use FAISS → find top-k semantically similar columns

Use LSH → add columns that contain literals

Prepare Schema Variants

(a) Focused schema + minimal profile

(b) Focused schema + maximal profile

(c) Full schema + minimal profile

(d) Full schema + maximal profile

(e) Focused schema + full profile

Generate SQL via LLM

For each schema variant, prompt LLM to generate SQL

Extract fields and literals used

Literal Correction

If a literal is not matched to correct column:

Find correct column via LSH

Augment schema

Ask LLM to revise SQL

Aggregate Results

Union all fields from all attempts → final linked schema
