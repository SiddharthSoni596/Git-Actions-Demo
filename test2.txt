4. Schema Linking Algorithm (Section 3)
Goal: Identify subset of columns most relevant to the question.

Steps:
Extract

Keywords and literals from the question

Build Focused Schema

Use FAISS → find top-k semantically similar columns

Use LSH → add columns that contain literals

Prepare Schema Variants

(a) Focused schema + minimal profile

(b) Focused schema + maximal profile

(c) Full schema + minimal profile

(d) Full schema + maximal profile

(e) Focused schema + full profile

Generate SQL via LLM

For each schema variant, prompt LLM to generate SQL

Extract fields and literals used

Literal Correction

If a literal is not matched to correct column:

Find correct column via LSH

Augment schema

Ask LLM to revise SQL

Aggregate Results

Union all fields from all attempts → final linked schema



SHORT_DESC_PROMPT = """
You are given the following information about a database column:
- Mechanical Profile (important): {mechanical_summary}
- Column Name: {column_name}
- Column Description (if any): {column_desc}
- Table Name: {table_name}
- Other Columns: {other_columns}

Task:
Generate a short description (max 25 words) that combines BOTH:
1. The purpose or meaning of the column (semantic meaning).
2. Any important patterns from the mechanical profile (e.g., numeric length, uniqueness).

Example:
Mechanical Profile: Column UserID has 0 NULL values, 100 distinct values, values are 10-digit numeric strings.
Expected Short Description: "Stores unique 10-digit numeric user identifiers."

Now write the short description:
