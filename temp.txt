Given the following:

NLQ (Natural Language Question):
{{NLQ}}

SQL Query:
{{SQL}}

Tasks:
1. Extract the following components from the SQL:
   - tables: All table names used in the query (including CTEs).
   - columns: All column names referenced (with aliases resolved).
   - aggregations: Any aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG, etc.) and their associated columns.
   - filters: All WHERE or HAVING conditions in plain English.
   - joins: All join conditions.
   - cte: Any Common Table Expressions (CTEs) with their role or purpose if identifiable.
   - subqueries: Any nested SELECT statements with their role in the query.
   - derived_columns: All derived columns including CASE statements, window functions, or calculated fields, along with:
       * the alias name
       * the original SQL expression
       * a plain English explanation of what it represents.
   - abbreviations: Expand common abbreviations in column names (e.g., txn_amt → Transaction Amount, cust_id → Customer ID).

2. Link these elements to business meaning:
   - For each metric or aggregation, explain its purpose in business terms.
   - For each derived column, explain what it means and why it might matter to the business.
   - For joins, describe the relationship in business terms (e.g., joining transactions with customers).
   - For subqueries or CTEs, summarize their role (e.g., filtering inactive customers, pre-aggregating data).

3. Provide a combined business-level interpretation:
   - A short description of what this query does in business language.
   - The business significance of the query result (why it matters).

Output the result in this exact JSON schema:

{
  "business_description": "",
  "business_significance": "",
  "tables": [],
  "columns": [],
  "aggregations": [],
  "filters": [],
  "joins": [],

Tasks:
1. Extract SQL components: tables, columns, aggregations, filters, joins, CTEs, subqueries, derived columns, abbreviations.
2. Derive intent_from_nlq: A single sentence summarizing the intent of the NLQ.
3. Generate business_description: What the query accomplishes in business terms, incorporating NLQ intent and SQL logic.
4. Generate business_significance: Why this query matters for business decision-making (use NLQ hints like time range, customer segment, metric).
5. Expand abbreviations where possible.
6. Return strictly in JSON format using the schema provided below.

#################################################################

You are a SQL structure extraction engine. Analyze the given SQL query and extract the following in valid JSON:

- tables: list all base tables used.
- columns: list all columns with their source table if identifiable.
- joins: list all join conditions in the format {left, right}.
- filters: list all WHERE and HAVING conditions as strings.
- ctes: list of {name, query, output_columns}.
- subqueries: list of {context (e.g., filter, select), query}.
- metrics: list of {alias, expression, aggregation_type}.
- abbreviations: list of short column names or underscored terms.

Rules:
- Do not guess business meaning.
- Do not expand abbreviations.
- Preserve query hierarchy.
- Output valid JSON only.

SQL:
{SQL_QUERY}
################################################################
You are a SQL lineage resolver. Given the SQL query and structured metadata, trace all aliases and metrics to their base columns. Provide the result as JSON with these keys:

- metrics: list of {alias, expression, aggregation_type (if any), base_columns: [table.column...], lineage_chain: alias → expression → base column mapping}.
- derived_columns: list of {alias, expression, depends_on: [aliases or columns]}.
- alias_lineage: map of alias → original table.column or expression.

Rules:
- Do not infer business meaning.
- If something cannot be resolved, use null.
- Return valid JSON only.

Input:
SQL: {SQL_QUERY}
Structured Metadata: {Stage_1A_Output}

############################################################################################################################

You are enriching SQL metadata with business context. Use the inputs to produce a JSON object with the following keys:

- intent_from_nlq: a concise description of what the user wants.
- business_description: summary of what the query is doing in business terms.
- business_significance: why this query matters to the business.
- metrics: list of metrics with {alias, business_meaning}.
- abbreviation_expansions: a map of {abbreviation: full form} using the provided glossary. If unknown, mark 'unresolved'.

You are an expert SQL and business metadata extraction engine.
Your task is to analyze a pair of:
1. A natural language question (NLQ) that describes the analyst's intent.
2. An SQL query that retrieves data for this NLQ.

You must:
- Extract technical components from the SQL.
- Use the NLQ to understand the intent and incorporate that into business interpretation.
- Provide output ONLY in valid JSON according to the given schema.
If any value cannot be derived, return null or empty arrays.

Follow these principles:
- Be precise and concise for business fields.
- Use NLQ to enhance 'business_description', 'business_significance', and 'intent_from_nlq'.
- Do NOT hallucinate column names or metrics.

########################################################################################################
You are a highly skilled data lineage and SQL analysis expert. Your goal is to analyze a pre-parsed SQL query structure and identify all important business terms, metrics, derived columns, and aliases, along with their complete lineage in terms of base columns, transformations, and source tables.

You are given the structured JSON output from a previous SQL parsing step. This JSON contains tables, columns, expressions, and their relationships.

Your task:

* Identify Key Business Terms & Derived Columns

 - Look for aliases or output column names that represent metrics, KPIs, business terms, or any computed/aggregated columns.

 - A business term can come from:

    Aggregations (e.g., SUM(sales_amount) → "total_sales")

    Calculations (e.g., price * quantity → "revenue")

    Conditional logic (e.g., CASE WHEN ... → "status_flag")

    Ratios, percentages, or composite metrics.

 - Exclude raw passthrough columns unless they have a specific business meaning (e.g., customer_id might not be a "metric", but customer_segment derived from mapping logic would be).

* Resolve Lineage

 - For each identified business term or derived column, find its full lineage:

   - All base columns used (with table references resolved, no aliases like a or t1 — use real table names).

   - Any intermediate derived fields it depends on.

   - The transformations or operations applied.

 - Lineage must be flattened to the lowest-level physical column(s) in source tables.

* Rules for Resolution

 - If an alias in the JSON is derived from another alias, recursively resolve until reaching base table columns.

 - If an expression contains nested logic (e.g., inside a CASE or subquery), fully expand it in lineage.

 - If the same derived column appears in multiple places (e.g., reused in another expression), still resolve it fully for each usage.

 - Ignore any unresolved or null source columns unless they can be inferred from context.

Output Format (JSON)
Output only valid JSON in the following structure:

{
  "business_terms": [
    {
      "term": "<alias_name_or_business_metric>",
      "expression": "<SQL_expression_as_seen_in_original_query>",
      "lineage": [
        {
          "table": "<fully_resolved_table_name>",
          "column": "<physical_column_name>"
        }
      ],
      "transformation_steps": [
        "Step 1: <base_column> from <table>",
        "Step 2: <operation or aggregation>",
        "Step 3: <final_alias_or_metric>"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
