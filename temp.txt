Given the following:

NLQ (Natural Language Question):
{{NLQ}}

SQL Query:
{{SQL}}

Tasks:
1. Extract the following components from the SQL:
   - tables: All table names used in the query (including CTEs).
   - columns: All column names referenced (with aliases resolved).
   - aggregations: Any aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG, etc.) and their associated columns.
   - filters: All WHERE or HAVING conditions in plain English.
   - joins: All join conditions.
   - cte: Any Common Table Expressions (CTEs) with their role or purpose if identifiable.
   - subqueries: Any nested SELECT statements with their role in the query.
   - derived_columns: All derived columns including CASE statements, window functions, or calculated fields, along with:
       * the alias name
       * the original SQL expression
       * a plain English explanation of what it represents.
   - abbreviations: Expand common abbreviations in column names (e.g., txn_amt → Transaction Amount, cust_id → Customer ID).

2. Link these elements to business meaning:
   - For each metric or aggregation, explain its purpose in business terms.
   - For each derived column, explain what it means and why it might matter to the business.
   - For joins, describe the relationship in business terms (e.g., joining transactions with customers).
   - For subqueries or CTEs, summarize their role (e.g., filtering inactive customers, pre-aggregating data).

3. Provide a combined business-level interpretation:
   - A short description of what this query does in business language.
   - The business significance of the query result (why it matters).

Output the result in this exact JSON schema:
